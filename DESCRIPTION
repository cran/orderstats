Title: Efficiently Generates Random Order Statistic Variables
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Christian Sims <christian_j_sims@yahoo.com>

Description: All the methods in this package generate a vector of uniform order statistics using a beta distribution and use an inverse cumulative distribution function for some distribution to give a vector of random order statistic variables for some distribution. This is much more efficient than using a loop since it is directly sampling from the order statistic distribution.
